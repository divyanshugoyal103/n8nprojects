Simplified LinkedIn Job Hunter - Easy Setup
I've created a completely simplified workflow that avoids the common issues. This version:

Eliminates the PDF handling that was causing problems (no resume file handling)
Uses standard n8n nodes to improve compatibility
Simplifies the data flow to reduce potential points of failure
Doesn't require AI integration which can sometimes be complex to set up

How to Set Up This Workflow:

Import the JSON into your n8n instance
Edit the "Set Job Search Parameters" node to configure:

linkedinSearchUrl: Your LinkedIn search URL with all filters applied
emailRecipient: Your email address
apifyApiKey: Your Apify API key
jobPreferences: Description of what you're looking for (for reference in the email)


Configure Email Settings:

Update the "Send Email" node with your SMTP settings or authentication
You can change the "fromEmail" address to something you prefer



What This Workflow Does:

Runs daily at 8:00 AM (configurable)
Scrapes LinkedIn jobs using Apify (no login required)
Processes job data into a clean format
Creates an HTML email with job listings
Sends you the top 10 jobs that match your search URL

Troubleshooting Tips:

If you get an error with Apify, double-check your API key
Make sure your LinkedIn search URL is from a private/incognito browser session
If emails aren't sending, check your email credentials in n8n
